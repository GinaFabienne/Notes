# 7 Steps of the Decision-Making Process - applied to tech


## Step 1: Identify the decision

### Some potential decisions could be:
    
    - Is a tech career for me?
    - Should I study a CS degree?

### Then ask WHY!

    - Why am I switching to a career in tech.
    - Why do I want to study a CS degree?
    - Why should I attend a coding bootcamp?

### Example Answers:
    - Is a tech career for me?
        Yes, I think so, but I have some concerns. I really like tech, there's lots of jobs and it seems like its going to be around for a few decades. But I'm worried that I'm:
            - Not smart enough
            - Not young enough
            - Don't have enough experience
### Pros:
    - Passion for tech
    - Jobs for tech and potential growth

### Cons:
    - Not smart enough
    - Not young enough
    - Don't have experience

## Step 2: Gather relevant information
Time to reserach your pros and cons!

    - Watch YouTube videos from other developers
    - Read blogs and ask advise from people in the industry
    - TALK to people about your concerns

## Step 3: Identify the alternatives
Alternatives to tech:

    - Teach History
    - Go back to a general corporate job
    - Study a masters in history

## Step 4: Weigh the evidence

Start with your Cons for Tech:

    - Not smart enough
    - Not young enough
    - Don't have experience

What cons are there for the alternatives:

    - Teaching history: few jobs and little pay

## Step 5: Choose among alternatives
Time to pause and Reassess!!

For example: 
    I'm not smart enough:

        - If I'm not smart enough I'll waste my time
        - If I waste my time I'll get even further behind
        - If I get more behind I won't be able to catch up
        - If I don't catch up I'll be stuck right where I am now, so why should I even try?

### Why should you try?


## Step 6: Take action

If you are still unsure:

    - Go back to the earlier questions and re-ask yourself them, Ask WHY, until to get to the root of the problem!

If you have made your decision to continue with tech:

    - It's time to start
    - Look for schools
    - Look for jobs
    - Research research research
    - Use this same method to decide between schools, bootcamps or jobs!

## Step 7: Review your decision

So you ahve taken action it's time to review and see where you are, are you:

    - Happy with your decision
    - Still worried and doubtful
    - Confused, scared, fearful?

All of these worries are normal, Just stay the path!
